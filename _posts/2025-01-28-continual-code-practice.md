# How to keep up your coding skills

Here are some resources for students, educators, and auto-didacts to help keep coding skills sharp. The expected use case is something like "student was taught coding on a course, but isn't regularly using skills, so wants to practice".

Most  of them are not bioinformatics specific, but are more general coding/data driven.
