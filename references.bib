  abstract  = {Abstract Motivation BioContainers (biocontainers.pro) is an
               open-source and community-driven framework which provides
               platform independent executable environments for bioinformatics
               software. BioContainers allows labs of all sizes to easily
               install bioinformatics software, maintain multiple versions of
               the same software and combine tools into powerful analysis
               pipelines. BioContainers is based on popular open-source projects
               Docker and rkt frameworks, that allow software to be installed
               and executed under an isolated and controlled environment. Also,
               it provides infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage
               and distribute bioinformatics containers with a special focus on
               omics technologies. These containers can be integrated into more
               comprehensive bioinformatics pipelines and different
               architectures (local desktop, cloud environments or HPC
               clusters). Availability and Implementation The software is freely
               available at github.com/BioContainers/.},
